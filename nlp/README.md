I would recommend starting up a python virtual environment 

cd into NLPproject which is the root
Run docker-compose up â€“build

It will take a few minutes as the pytorch package is large

After build is successful and docker is up, go to browser and run:
http://localhost:3000/

You can test any sentence and it will extract some key words:
For example: 'I would like a soothing piano track' , 'A futuristic soundscape with electronic beats.'

Currently nlp_model.py applies a fine tuned [distilbert model](https://huggingface.co/ml6team/keyphrase-extraction-distilbert-inspec) which is a better performing one. There is some text processing to aid the model for music keywords as it is tested on unknown data hence may not recognize all possible words. If keywords extracted are more than 3 it returns the top 3 words scored for the purposes of the freesound api.
